## Folders and Files Structure

Your project directory should look something like this:

```
Pdf Viewer
  node_modules/
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    manifest.json
  src/
    actions/
    components/
    containers/
    middleware/
    reducers/
    types/
    App.js
    index.js
    serviceWorker.js
 .env.local
 .gitignore
 package.json
 package-lock.json
 README.md
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise, Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.
